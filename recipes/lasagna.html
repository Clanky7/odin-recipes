                    <p>mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, 
                        made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
                        A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
                        I have found none better anywhere. 
                        Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
