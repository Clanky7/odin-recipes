                        <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, 20 to 25 minutes.</li>
                        <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Drain potatoes, then return to the pot. Turn heat to high and allow potatoes to dry for about 30 seconds. Turn off heat. </li>
                        <li><strong>Step 3</strong> Mash potatoes with a potato masher twice around the pot, then add milk and butter. Continue to mash until smooth and fluffy. Whisk in salt and black pepper until evenly distributed, about 15 seconds. </li>
